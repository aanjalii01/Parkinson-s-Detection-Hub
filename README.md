## *Project Overview*

This project detects Parkinson's disease using machine learning. It involves several steps, including preprocessing patient data, training a model using a labeled dataset, and using that model to predict whether new patients are likely to have Parkinson's disease.

---

## *Features*
- *Disease Classification*: Classify patients into "Parkinson's" or "Not Parkinson's" based on their health data.
- *Data Preprocessing*: The raw patient data is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for model training.
- *Model Training*: Train a machine learning model using various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
- *Prediction*: Predict whether a new patient is likely to have Parkinson's disease based on the trained model.

---

## *Technologies Used*
- *Python*: Programming language.
- *Scikit-learn*: Library for machine learning algorithms.
- *Pandas*: Data manipulation and analysis.
- *NumPy*: Library for numerical computing.
- *Flask* (optional): Can be used to deploy the model as a web service.
- *Pickle*: For saving and loading the trained model.
